# iostream_python

Hi!This is funny python module, which can add cin and cout from C++!
You should make a new variable with "inout" type, and use "cin>>" for input the variable, and "cout<<" for print the variable

Also you can use the endl!

E.X:
<p></p>
from iostream import *
<p></p>a=inout()
<p></p>b=inout()
<p></p>cin >> a >> b
<p></p>cout << inout(int(a)+int(b)) << endl
<p></p>
<p></p>
Sorry for my English🤡


note:
cin is working how input(), long story short, you should press enter, for input next variable
