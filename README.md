# iostream_python

Hi!This is funny python module, which can add cin and cout from C++!\
You should make a new variable with "inout" type, and use "cin>>" for input the variable, and "cout<<" for print the variable\
\
Also you can use the endl!\
\
E.X:

	from iostream import *
	a=inout()
	b=inout()
	cin >> a >> b  #1\n2
	cout << int(a)+int(b) << endl  #3\n


\
note:\
\
cin is working like input(), in short, you should press enter, for input next variable\
Attention, crutchesğŸ¤¡
